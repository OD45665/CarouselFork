## Getting Started

The module expects Bootstrap 4 to be used by the Orchard Core CMS website. The module does not come with Bootstrap 4 CSS and JS. Make sure your theme includes the necessary assets for the Carousel to look and work properly.

Add the NuGet package, **Carousel.OrchardCore**, to the Orchard Core CMS Website. Launch the website and sign in as an administrator to enable the module from the dashboard under <i>Configuration</i> -> <i>Features</i>.

Create a <em>Carousel Widget</em> in a Layer or as part of a Content Item that supports Flow. The editor provides access to all of the current Carousel settings as well as the ability to add slides.

After choosing the desired settings and adding the slides, navigate to the appropriate area of your website to view the carousel.

For more information on Bootstrap 4's Carousel, visit the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com).

## Customization

The Carousel Widget produces the suggested HTML mentioned in the Bootstrap documentation and allows one to create a Carousel with no knowledge of HTML.

You can, however, customize the HTML by modifying the liquid template that comes with the module, <em>Widget-Carousel.liquid</em>. You can modify the file itself or add the file as a template from the dashboard under <i>Configuration</i> -> <i>Templates</i>.

See the Orchard Core Documentation for more information on [Templates](https://orchardcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Templates/README/).

## Road map

There are no plans to add any additional features at this time.

## Note

Bug in Orchard Core 1.0.0-rc2 when displaying checkbox as a switch so modified to just use checkbox. [#3944](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/3944)
